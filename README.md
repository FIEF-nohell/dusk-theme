# Dusk Theme

A refined dark VS Code theme inspired by **Jellyfish**, reworked with a deeper, darker purple atmosphere.

Dusk keeps the calm, distraction-free philosophy of Jellyfish while pushing the palette toward richer shadows, muted violets, and stronger contrast for long coding sessions.

## 🎨 Inspiration & Credits

Dusk is a **fork of the Jellyfish theme** by *neru devs*.

Jellyfish provided the foundation and philosophy:
> calm, zen-like coding without unnecessary visual distractions.

Dusk builds on that idea by introducing:
- darker base tones  
- a restrained purple color direction  
- slightly higher contrast for readability  

All credit to the original Jellyfish theme for the inspiration.
